Importance of Identifying Design Properties of a Mock-Up Design
Identifying design properties in a mock-up is crucial because:

Ensures Consistency: Defined styles guarantee a uniform appearance across the application, improving usability and branding.
Enhances Efficiency: Developers can refer to predefined properties, reducing guesswork and speeding up the development process.
Improves Collaboration: Designers and developers can align their efforts by referring to clear design guidelines.
Supports Scalability: Reusable design properties make it easier to introduce new features without disrupting the existing design.
Creates a Cohesive Experience: A well-thought-out UI/UX design enhances user satisfaction and engagement.
